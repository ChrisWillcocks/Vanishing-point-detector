# Vanishing-point-detector

Open-spec University project for computer vision. This program will:
- convert an image to greyscale
- Canny edge detector to find edges
- Hough lines function to find vanishing lines
- calculate equation of lines and line crossing point

The included report and presentation go into more detail and showcase results. Originally written with C++ in Visual Studio, using OpenCV 3.4.0.
